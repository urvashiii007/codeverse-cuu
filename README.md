CodeVerse — Real-Time Collaborative Coding Platform

CodeVerse is a Google-Docs-style live collaborative IDE that allows multiple developers to code, chat, test, and plan together inside a single shared workspace — without any setup or configuration.

Built for hackathons, students, remote teams, and pair-programming, CodeVerse removes collaboration friction and makes teamwork smooth and productive.

Key Features

Real-time collaborative code editing (sub-second sync)
Multi-file explorer with folder structure
Built-in group chat and online/offline presence
Collaborative drawing board for logic, UI & architecture
Run code inside the platform without external compilers
Custom themes and font settings
Download complete project as a ZIP
Planned Copilot-style AI Assistant for code generation and debugging

Why CodeVerse Is Unique

Unlike traditional collaborative editors that only sync text, CodeVerse integrates coding, planning, communication, execution, and AI assistance into one screen.
Teams can write code, discuss ideas, sketch logic, and run programs in the same room without switching tools or requiring additional software, making remote collaboration seamless and efficient.
